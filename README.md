# GraphSight

GraphSight is the open source ORM and static analysis library that enables integration with C# applications for the creation and measure of application analytics within Tigergraph. 

### Future Implementations: 
Currently experiencing an issue with static analysis outside of scoped namespace. Additional future supported changes include
  - Mapping data from Tigergraph to objects
  - Better Error handling for API calls 
  - Additional API support
