# GraphSight

GraphSight is the open source library that enables integration with C# applications for the creation and measure of application analytics.

## NOTE TO JUDGES: 

Hi all! We wanted to let you know that we had some issues approaching the deadline that had a devastating impact on our ability to submit a complete solution. Note that this submission has some issues - we have one line of code that is broken for one of the functions. Additionally, we are working on resolving completion of our analytics functions (Which happens to be the primary goal of this project). Because of this, we were not able to complete some of the core functionality of the project. This branch will mark the submission at this point, however we will still be working on making the fixes necessary and getting this project through and finished!

You can see how the project is supposed to be used within the sample project in this repo. Please read the comments as they will point out what works and what doesn't. If you want to see our ongoing progress while judging is underway, feel free to check out our commits on the other branch. 

### Future Implementations: 
Currently we will be working on the mentioned fixes, as well as 
  - Mapping data from Tigergraph to objects
  - Better Error handling for API calls 
  - Additional API support
